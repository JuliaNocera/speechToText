# speechToText
Playing around with speech APIs and translating voice to text

## Starts off with an *extremely* simple one file (index.html) as a quick proof of concept

### Ideas:
  * React (Redux?) ify it
  * Text selector (multi select) for various languages to detect voice better
  * Translations
    * Translate text into language of choice
    * Editable text after voice translation && type only interface
    * Upload audio to translate (this could be for translating a song... ? possibly)
    * search various sites with text - Reddit, google, facebook - and return results of each rendered on page as clickable links (voice search for the internet)
